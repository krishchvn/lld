// Amazon wants to build a system to compute few performance metrics for 3rd party sellers
// based on their customer order delivery experience
// Amazon customers want their orders delivered by the promised date and especially for
// buisness customers, it is also important that the orders are delivered during open buisness
// hours (Mon-Fri, 9am - 5pm)

// Build a data model and implement a code logic to compute these performance metrics for an
// input seller over all his orderService.
// You can assume that the dataset for these data models will be populated for you offline
// and you can call APIs to collect those dataset
// Implement the system in such a way that you can initially compute the following two
// performance metrics and ensure that it is flexible enough to add additional metrics later

// *Timely-Delivery-Rate (TDR) measures the fraction of total orders that arrived before or on
// promised delivery Date
// *Open-Hour-Delivery-Rate (OHDR) measures the fraction of total orders that were delivered
// during open business hours (Mon-Fri, 9am-5pm)
